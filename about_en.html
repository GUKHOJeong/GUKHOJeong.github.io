                    <h2>1. Personal Journey & Values</h2>
                    <p>While in university, I found a new turning point in the field of data analysis. As a humanities major, data analysis was initially a foreign and challenging area, but I was deeply fascinated by its power to understand the world and solve problems. This experience reignited my passion for learning and led me to immerse myself in developing data-driven problem-solving skills.</p>
                    <p>Driven by a thirst for this new field, I actively developed my skills by continuously taking related courses and participating in government-funded training programs. This proactive learning journey helped me realize the joy and value of learning and growing through new challenges. It became the foundation for a mindset of continuous learning and a readiness to take on new challenges.</p>

                    <h2>2. Motivation for the Role</h2>
                    <p>Data analysis was a turning point for me, bringing a profound joy in problem-solving. Going beyond just dealing with numbers, I've come to deeply appreciate how data helps me understand the world and grow. This has naturally led me to focus on developing my skills in data-driven problem interpretation.</p>
                    <p>Through a bootcamp, I experienced the entire AI model development process, from ML/DL and CV to LLM. This journey solidified my belief that my data analysis and AI model development skills can play a crucial role in creating applications that provide real value to users. I find the greatest reward in structuring complex data and extracting meaningful insights to apply to real-world business challenges.</p>
                    <p>I am passionate about using data to innovate user experiences and drive business growth. With this passion, I want to develop sophisticated recommendation systems and predictive models to maximize service efficiency and user satisfaction, ultimately playing a key role in leading new industry trends.</p>

                    <h2>3. A Key Achievement</h2>
                    <p>In a project to analyze changes in marine fishing catch distribution based on climate change, we focused on understanding and predicting the impact of marine climate factors on fishing yields. However, due to the extreme volatility and complexity of the catch data, we faced challenges in ensuring predictive accuracy, with high RMSE and MAE scores.</p>
                    <p>Despite these quantitative limitations, our team persevered, delving deeply into domestic and international research papers and case studies. This process led us to a critical insight: contrary to our initial assumptions, the primary drivers of catch fluctuations were not changes in water temperature and the marine environment, but rather direct human fishing activities and policy intervention.</p>
                    <p>This realization was a crucial turning point. It moved us beyond simply improving a predictive model and allowed us to propose practical policy directions for managing fishing yields and conserving marine resources. Through this experience, I gained a broader perspective on understanding the inherent limitations of data and grasping the essence of complex problems. Ultimately, this project equipped me with the data-driven decision-making skills needed to identify core issues and drive tangible change.</p>

                    <h2>4. Preparation for the Role</h2>
                    <p>At university, I built a strong foundation in data analysis and systematically enhanced my problem-solving abilities by obtaining certifications such as the Advanced Data Analytics Semi-Professional(ADsP), SQL Developer (SQLD), and Engineer Big Data Analytics. This process solidified my fundamental statistical knowledge and honed my meticulous data analysis skills.</p>
                    <p>Subsequently, in an AI model development bootcamp, I gained in-depth knowledge of various AI technologies including ML/DL, computer vision (CV), and LLM, experiencing the entire process from model design to tuning and deployment. I gained practical experience using key libraries like Numpy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, effectively building the necessary skills for commercial service and product development.</p>
                    <p>Based on this, in the 'Facial Expression Practice Application' project, I took the lead from data preprocessing and modeling to commercialization using MLOps. This experience demonstrates my capability in developing recommendation models and applying and serving ML models in real-world services. This background in data analysis, AI model development, and commercialization shows I am ready to directly contribute to tasks like ML model serving, recommendation models, and time series data development, helping to innovate services and drive results.</p>
